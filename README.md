## Introduction

This repository documents my progress through **100 Days of Code**, a personal challenge where I commit to solving one or more LeetCode problems each day for 100 days using C++. The problems range from easy to hard and cover topics like arrays, strings, dynamic programming, trees, and more.

The aim is to improve problem-solving skills, get comfortable with algorithms and data structures, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Goals

- Solve at least one LeetCode problem daily for 100 days.
- Improve proficiency in C++ and algorithmic problem-solving.
- Write clear, efficient, and well-documented code.
- Track progress and reflect on solutions through this repository.
